# Global Components By Terra

A pre-built HTML and SCSS framework that provides readily usable components. Users can easily integrate these components into their projects by simply copying and pasting the code. This framework aims to streamline the development process by offering a collection of pre-designed elements that can be easily incorporated into web projects for increased efficiency and consistency.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP File
2. Add the File to the Root of Your Project
3. Install the File using npm

```sh
npm install terra-hq-gc-0.0.3.tgz
```

## Import Mixins Globally

Import the mixins globally according to the build tool you are using.

#### Example in Webpack:

In your Webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js):

```sh
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      // Sass Loader
      {
        use: [
          {
            options: {
              resources: [
                path.resolve(__dirname, "@terra-hq/gc/library"),
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

#### Example in Astro:

In your Astro configuration file (astro.config.mjs):

```sh
export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        scss: {
          additionalData: `
            @import '@terra-hq/gc/library';
          `,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Global variables

The components within this framework make extensive use of variables, allowing for easy customization based on project-specific values.
Create a stylesheet with the provided global variables and adjust them according to your project's needs.

```scss
//* GLOBAL VARIABLES
$g-viewport-type: max-width; //* It's used for mediaqueries; max-width (desktop first) or min-with (mobile first)
$g-measure: 0.5rem; //* Measurement on which the spaces are based. All spaces are multiples of this number
$g-container-class: f--container; //* The class used for the container
$g-row-class: f--row; //* The class used for the row
$g-row-remove-gutter-class: f--row--remove-gutter; //* The class used for the row without gutter. If that class doesn't exist, you can use the same one as for a normal row
$g-transition-duration: 0.3s; //* The duration of all hover transitions
$g-transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(
    0.2,
    0,
    0.38,
    0.9
); //* The function of all hover transitions (linear, ease, ease-in-ot...)

//* btn
$btn-padding: $g-measure $g-measure * 3; //* The padding for buttons that have space around them
$btn-icon-gap: $g-measure; //* The space between icon and text in buttons with icon
$btn-full-width-breakpoint: 580px; //* The breakpoint at which we want buttons with padding should either expand to 100% width of the parent or stop being 100% width. If you never want them to be 100% width, you can omit this variable.

//* pill
$pill-padding: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The padding for pills that have space around them

//* form fields
$form-margin-bottom: $g-measure * 3; //* The margin-bottom for form fields
$input-padding: $g-measure * 0.5 $g-measure; //* The padding for form fields (input, textarea, select...) that have space around them
$file-btn-padding: $g-measure * 0.5 $g-measure * 3; //* The padding for the button of input type file

//* card
$card-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all cards
$card-item-list-gap: $g-measure; //* The space between all possible lists in cards. Possible lists refer to the last text element of all cards containing more than one text element. This value could be a single number (indicating equal space in both X and Y directions) or two numbers, for example, $g-measure $g-measure*2 (Y X)
$card-media-text-space: $g-measure * 2; //* The spacing between text and media items (videos, images, etc.) in all cards
$card-media-text-space-responsive: $g-measure; //* The spacing between text and media items in all cards from the breakpoint specified in $card-spaces-breakpoint onward

//* CTA
$cta-item-list-gap: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The space between all possible lists in CTAs. Possible lists refer to the last text element of all CTAs containing more than one text element. This value could be a single number (indicating equal space in both X and Y directions) or two numbers, for example, $g-measure $g-measure*2 (Y X)
$cta-outside-container-col-class: (f--col-9 f--col-desktop-8);
$cta-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'no'
$cta-inside-container-padding: $g-measure * 15 $g-measure * 10; //* The padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'no'. This variable can be a single number, a list of numbers, a class, or a list of classes
$cta-inside-container-padding-responsive: $g-measure * 10 $g-measure * 7; //* The padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'no' from the breakpoint specified in $cta-spaces-breakpoint onward
$cta-outside-container-padding-y: $g-measure * 20; //* The top and bottom padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'yes'. This must be a single number
$cta-outside-container-padding-y-responsive: $g-measure * 10; //* The top and bottom padding for the CTAs when the 'container' is set to 'yes' from the breakpoint specified in $cta-spaces-breakpoint onward

//* layout
$layout-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all layouts
$layout-item-list-gap: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The space between all possible lists in layouts. Possible lists refer to the last text element of all layouts containing more than one text element. This value could be a single number (indicating equal space in both X and Y directions) or two numbers, for example, $g-measure $g-measure*2 (Y X)

//* hero
$hero-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all heroes
$hero-item-list-gap: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The space between all possible lists in heroes. Possible lists refer to the last text element of all heroes containing more than one text element. This value could be a single number (indicating equal space in both X and Y directions) or two numbers, for example, $g-measure $g-measure*2 (Y X)

//* 404
$error-404-spaces-breakpoint: 810px; //* The breakpoint at which the spacing changes for all 404
$error-404-item-list-gap: $g-measure $g-measure * 2; //* The space between all possible lists in 404. Possible lists refer to the last text element of all heroes containing more than one text element. This value could be a single number (indicating equal space in both X and Y directions) or two numbers, for example, $g-measure $g-measure*2 (Y X)
```

Ensure to adjust these variables based on the specific requirements of your project.

## Flexible Layout System

To incorporate layouts featuring two columns and full-screen Call to Action (CTA) elements, it's essential to employ a Flexbox-based container and row system. This ensures the proper structuring and responsiveness required for these specific components to seamlessly integrate into your project.

## Media

In any section containing media elements such as images, videos, etc., you have the flexibility to insert images, videos, Lotties, or embed codes.

For images, we utilize a [lazy-loading package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blazy) to enhance performance and optimize the loading of content.

For Lottie animations, we use [another package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lottie-web) for seamless integration and smooth playback
